This blog post will be the first part of a series called "Neural Network Math", where each post will reveal the mathematics used to achieve the desired results with neural networks. To start, only the basics will be covered, but as the posts progress, so will the complexity. The goal of these posts is to peak under the hood of the neural networks to see what actually happens. For example, we can all learn to drive a car. Press the accelerator, turn the wheel, use breaks when necessary (obviously oversimplified), but not everyone understands exactly what happens inside the car that makes it accelerate or decelerate. How does the engine work and where does the gas travel throughout the car? These are the types of questions I hope to find the answers to (unfortunately, I will not be telling you how a car works).
