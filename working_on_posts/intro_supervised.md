# A Brief Introduction to Supervised Learning

<b>Summary:</b> In this post I will discuss the details of <b>supervised</b> machine learning and its applications. Code examples will be used for demonstration but the theory and background knowledge will be the main focus.

Supervised learning is the most common subbranch of machine learning today. Typically, new machine learning practitioners will begin their journey with supervised learning algorithms. Therefore, the first of this three post series will be about supervised learning.

Supervised machine learning algorithms are designed to learn by example. When training a supervised learning algorithm, the training data will consist of inputs paired with the correct outputs. During training, the algorithm will search for patterns in the data that correlate with the desired outputs. After training, a supervised learning algorithm will take in new unseen inputs and will determine which label the new inputs will be classified as based on prior training data. The objective of a supervised learning model is to predict the correct label for newly presented input data. At its most basic form, a supervised learning algorithm can be written simply as:

Where *Y* is the predicted output that is based on whatever function the model finds that best fits *x* (the features in the input data).

Supervised learning can be split into two subcategories: <b>Classification</b> and <b>regression</b>.

### Classification



### Regression
