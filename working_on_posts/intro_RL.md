<b>Summary:</b> In this post I will discuss the details of <b>reinforcement learning</b> and its applications. Code examples will be used for demonstration but the theory and background knowledge will be the main focus.

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a relatively newer approach to tackling a different set of machine learning tasks. RL is becoming increasingly popular due companies such as DeepMind and OpenAI having massive success in projects such as [AlphaGo Zero](https://deepmind.com/blog/alphago-zero-learning-scratch/) and the [Gym](https://gym.openai.com) python library.
