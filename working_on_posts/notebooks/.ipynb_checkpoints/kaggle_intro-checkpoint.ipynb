    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) is an amazing community for aspiring data scientists and machine learning practitioners to come together to solve data science-realted problems in a competition setting. Many statisticians and data scientists compete within a friendly community with a goal of producing the best models for predicting and analyzing datasets. Any company with a dataset and a problem to solve can benefit from Kagglers. Kaggle has not only provided a professional setting for data science projects, but has developed an environment for newcomers to learn and practice data science and machine learning skills.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This blog will serve as an introduction to the Kaggle platform and will give a brief walkthrough of the process of joining competitions, taking part in discussions, creating kernels, and progressing through the rankings."

    "## Kaggle Progression System\n",
    "\n",
    "Kaggle has a ranking system that helps data scientists track their progress and performance. Medals are awarded for certain activities that are completed. When a Kaggler earns enough medals to move up a tier in the progression system, they rank up!\n",
    "\n",
    "Kaggle ranking can come from three different \"categories of expertise\": <b>Competitons</b>, <b>Kernels</b>, and <b>Discussion</b>. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the three categories has five ranks: <b>Novice</b>, <b>Contributer</b>, <b>Expert</b>, <b>Master</b>, and <b>Grandmaster</b>. The majority of Kaggle's users are considered a \"Novice\", which essentially means they have not interacted with the community and have not run any scripts or made any competition submissions. Every user above the Novice level has made submissions and has used datasets to make predictions and analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "A word to the wise, learn from everyone on Kaggle, especially the higher ranking individuals! One of the reasons behind Kaggle's great success is its learning-friendly environment and the ease of learning new skills. Watching video tutorials about data science techinques is a great start, but there is nothing more valuable than reading through an experienced data scientist's kernel and explanations, then using the skills you learned in your own models."

Kaggle provides six unique forums in the discussion board where each forum has a different purpose.\n",

    "Under Kaggle's \"Competition\" tab there are many competitions that you can join. This is just like the \"Datasets\" tab, where you can click on the competition and download the data for your models. There are a few competitions that are desined for beginners to enter and learn the basics of Kaggle and data science. One of the beginner friendly competitions is the famous MNSIT dataset, where we will create a model that will classify handwritten digits and produce predictions on test data. This blog post will use the MNIST dataset and will submit predictions to the competition as well. The first thing we need to do is look at our data and start thinking about building our model. To begin, we can start a new <b>kernel</b>."

Kernels allow a Kaggler to create and run code from within the browser without needing to download Python and the packages on their machine. One type of kernel that Kaggle provides is a notebook. If you are familiar with Jupyter Notebooks, then you are familiar with Kaggle's notebooks because they are the same thing!\n",

    "We will need to create our kernel, to do this, we can click \"Create Kernel\" and choose the \"Notebook\" option to do our analysis in Jupyter Notebook. Once the notebook opens, you will notice some prewritten code known as \"starter code\". Starter code will import some common libraries and will print the directories within the data folder. For this blog, we will delete the starter code and write our imports by ourselves. In the first notebook cell, we will write all of the necessary imports for our project and we will print out everything that is in the \"digit_data\" folder that we downloaded."

    "Another amazing high-level Python library that is used a lot in data science for visualization is Seaborn. Seaborn is a data visualization library that is heavily based on matplotlib, but is known to make more attractive graphics. Since we like attractiveness, we will work with Seaborn to visualize how many samples of each digit we have in our training set. After visualizing the balance within the data and after using pandas to view the exact amount of samples, we can confidently say that our data is very well balanced and that no digits are overrepresented.
