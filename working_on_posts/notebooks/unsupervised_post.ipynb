    "Unsupervised learning is a branch of machine learning that is used to manifest underlying patterns in data. Unsupervised learning does not use labeled data, but instead focuses on the data's features. Labeled training data is data where each input is accompanied by it's correlated output. When using unsupervised learning, we are not concerned with the targeted outputs because making predictions is not the desired outcome of unsupervised learning algorithms. Supervised learning is concerned with labeled data in order to make predictions, but unsupervised is not.\n",

    "\n",
    "The goal of unsupervised learning algorithms is to analyze data and find important features. Unsupervised learning will often find subgroups or hidden patterns within the dataset that a human observer may not pick up on. This is shown in the figure above. With the given image, any human can pick out the subgroups, but with a more complex dataset, these subgroups may not be so easy to find. This is where unsupervised learning can help us.\n",

    "\n",
    "Clustering is the simplest and among the most common applications of unsupervised learning. Clustering aims to discover \"clusters\", or subgroups within unlabeled data. Clusters will contain data points that are as similar as possible to each other, and as dissimilar as possible to data points in other clusters. Clustering helps find underlying patterns within the data that may not be noticeable to a human observer.\n"

    "\n",
    "In k-means clustering, the goal is to partition the data into a predetermined value for *K*, the number of clusters. Each data point will fall into only one cluster of the *K* clusters, and therefore the clusters will not overlap.  "
