    "Unsupervised learning is a branch of machine learning that is used to manifest underlying patterns in data. Unsupervised learning does not use labeled data, but instead focuses on the data's features. Labeled training data is data where each input is accompanied by it's correlated output. When using unsupervised learning, we are not concerned with the targeted outputs because making predictions is not the desired outcome of unsupervised learning algorithms. Supervised learning is concerned with labeled data in order to make predictions, but unsupervised is not.\n",
