    "# Simple Neural Networks: Revised\n",
    "\n",
    "Back in February I published a post title [<i>Simple Neural Networks with Numpy</i>](https://a-i-dan.github.io/tanh_NN). I wanted to take a deep dive into the world of neural networks and learn everything that went into making a neural net seem \"magical\". Now, a few months later, I want to rewrite that post. At the time of the original post, I was a novice in both machine learning and the Python language. While I still consider myself in the beginning stages of my growth, I have learned a lot in the recent months and have realized the mistakes that were made in my original post. I thought about deleting the post and rewriting it, but I made this blog to keep a track record of my progress, and deleting the original post goes against this idea. I am sure there will be mistakes in this post as well as I am still learning this field.\n",
    "\n",
    "This blog post will be a revised, and way better, version of my original blog post with a similar title. Unlike the original post, in this post, building the neural network's architecture will be achieved by taking an object-oriented approach (this is mainly to help me learn). Therefore, the code will not be the most efficient code possible and will be a bit more lengthy. This neural network will contain one hidden layer and will be using the <b>sigmoid activation function</b>. The full code for this project will be posted below (including plot and predictions), then blocks of code will be seperated and explained in further detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Neural Network?\n",
    "\n",
    "A neural network is loosely based on how the human brain works: many neurons connected to other neurons, passing information through their connections and firing when the input to a neuron surpasses a certain threshold. Our artificial neural network will consist of artificial neurons and synapses with information being passed between them. The synapses, or connections, will be weighted according to the neurons strength of influence on determining the output. These synaptic weights will go through an optimization process called <b>backpropagation</b>. For each iteration during the training process, backpropagation will be used to go backwards through the layers of the network and adjusts the weights according to their contribution to the neural net's error. \n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks are essentially self-optimizing functions that map inputs to the correct outputs. We can then place a new input into the function, where it will predict an output based on the function it created with the training data.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Neural Net's Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "This neural network, like all neural networks, will have to learn what the important features are in the data to produce the output. In paticular, this neural net will be given an input matrix with six samples, each with three feature columns consisting of soley zeros and ones. For example, one sample in the training set may be [0, 1, 1]. The output to each sample will be a single one or zero. The output will be determined by the number in the first feature column of the data samples. Using the example given before, the output for [0, 1, 1] would be 0, because the first column contains a zero. An example chart will be given below to demonstrate the output for each input sample.\n",

The sigmoid function is a popular nonlinear activation function that has a range of (0-1). The inputs to this function will always be squished down to fit inbetween the sigmoid function's two horizontal asymptotes at y=0 and y=1. The sigmoid function has some well known issues that restrict its usage. When we look at the graph below of the sigmoidal curve, we notice that as we reach the two ends of the curve, the derivatives of those points become very small. When these small derivatives are multiplied during backpropagation, they become smaller and smaller until becoming useless. Due to the derivatives, or gradients, getting smaller and smaller, the weights in the neural network will not be updated very much, if at all.

If the slope is a lower value, the neural network is confident in its prediction, and less movement of the weights is needed. If the slope is of a higher value, then the neural networks predictions are closer to .50, or 50% (The highest slope value possible for the sigmoid function is at x=0 and y=.5. y is the prediction.).
