I feel its only right to start my first post off with my first introduction to programming.

Here is the most basic  python program that everyone learns on day one.
```python
print('Hello, world!')
```
So what is happening?

Notice the first word in our code is print. The print function in Python basically tells your computer what to display, or print, on the screen.

What about inside the parenthesis?

What is inside the parenthesis is called a string. Technically it’s an array of characters.  A string is a type of data that resembles a sentence and is most often wrapped in quotation marks. You can you use single quotes ( ‘ ‘ ) or double quotes ( ” ” ), but you can not mix them. If you start with single quotes you must end in single quotes, and vice versa.

What about apostrophes?

For example `print('Dave's funny')` would not work. In this case you would have to use a backslash ( \ ) , which is called an escape character. The backslash tells the computer to print the apostrophe, but not to use it to end your string. Always put the backslash before the apostrophe. As seen below.

For example `print('Dave\'s funny')` would be correct.

Another way you could write this is by using double quotes to wrap around the whole string. In this case, you would not need a backslash. The computer would know that the apostrophe is part of your string.

For example 
```python 
print("Dave's funny")
```

I hope this helped you understand the basic python "Hello, world" program.

```python 
print('Hello, world!')
```
