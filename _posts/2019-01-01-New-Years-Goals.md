# New Years Goals (2019)


We have recently transitioned into the year 2019. I have decided to write out a few goals that I currently have in mind to complete throughout 2019.

This post will include a list of five goals for 2019, as well as a description.

<b>(1) Graduate High School / Start College</b>

Perhaps the easiest goal I have is to simply graduate high school. I am scheduled to graduate on January 23, and I do not believe it is possible to not achieve this goal.

In fact, the funny part is that I start college before I graduate high school. My college classes begin on January 16, but I do not graduate until January 23.

On top of starting college this year, I would also like to finish 2019 with a GPA above 3.80.

These are easy, achievable goals.


<b>(2) Read Forty Books / Write Book Reviews</b>

This goal is also a more achievable goal. My reading pace usually puts me at one week per book (obviously very dependent on book length).

I recently purchased a few books to start this year off. I plan to write book reviews on a few of these books. I think writing book reviews on all of the books I read might be a little excessive, but I will see.


<b>(3) Receive Purple Belt In BJJ</b>

I received my blue belt in Brazilian jiu jitsu (BJJ) when I was 16, and I hope to work towards my purple belt this year. I hope to receive my purple belt as an 18 year old.

I recently was out of training for about two months due to some complications, but I am back training consistently and training hard. I may even be teaching some kids classes this year as well.


<b>(4) Expand Knowledge of PyTorch, Tensorflow and Keras</b>

I would like to become more proficient in PyTorch, Tensorflow and Keras.  

My focus this year will be learning all I can about PyTorch. But I would like to also take some time to learn more about Tensorflow and Keras. This goal will enable me to become better equipped to take on any ML/DL challenge I come in contact with.


<b>(5) Study and Implement Reinforcement Learning (RL)</b>

This one is my favorite.

In my opinion, RL is the key to advancement in artificial intelligence. I plan on rewatching David Silver's lectures on Youtube, among many others, and reading as many books as I can about the subject.

RL is something I am very interested in and have read a lot about. I have been reading papers published by OpenAI and DeepMind and plan on understanding all of the little details within the papers that I did not understand my first time reading through them.
