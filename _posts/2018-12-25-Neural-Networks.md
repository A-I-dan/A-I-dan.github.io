# What Are Artificial Neural Networks (With Simple Python Example)

<hr>
In this post I will go over what a neural network (NN) is and how they are implemented with simple Python code examples. Big thanks to Andrew Trask for creating an amazing [blog post](http://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/) that really helped me grasp the concepts.


Here is the code condensed down to 15 lines:

Alright... So what is that stuff?


First I will explain a bit about artificial neural networks and how they work. Then later, I will move on to break down each line of the above code.


<h2>What is an Artificial Neural Network?</h1>


An artificial neural network (ANN) is a computer program that is modeled off of your own brain. Your brain consists of an estimated 100 billion neurons, each with many <b>dendrites</b>, the neurons input connections, and only one <b>axon</b>, the neurons output connection.


Below I drew up a quick diagram of a neuron:

An ANN attempts to simulate the neurons in the human brain.
